С SQLite RowSet:execute() не захотел работать. Почему не разобрался. Может не предоставляется
поставщиком такая возможность работы?


The following interfaces in the javax.sql.rowset package define five types of rowsets:
    • JdbcRowSet
    • CachedRowSet
    • WebRowSet
    • FilteredRowSet
    • JoinRowSet
Each type of rowset has features that are suitable for specific needs. All these rowset interfaces inherit, directly
or indirectly, from the RowSet interface. The RowSet interface is inherited from the ResultSet interface. Therefore,
all methods in the ResultSet interface are also available in all types of rowsets.

Typically, database vendors are supposed to provide implementation classes for rowsets. 
They may provide them as part of their JDBC driver or as a separate bundle. 
Third parties can also provide rowset implementation classes. As a developer, you can also provide rowset
implementations to suit specific needs.
